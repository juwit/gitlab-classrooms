**GitLab Classroom** is a modest clone of [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), aimed at GitLab.

## Features

**GitLab Classrooms** helps _Teachers_ to:

* create GitLab groups for a class
* give assignment for the _Students_
* automate _Students_ repositories creation in the Group
* use project templates, to have a code skeleton to start with
* grade work automatically by importing test results

For _Students_, **GitLab Classrooms** help them to:

* access their assignments
* create their repositories automatically by simply joining a classroom with a magic link
* see their grade on each assignment

**GitLab Classroom** uses GitLab OAuth2 provider to authenticate _Teachers_ and _Students_, so no account management is required.

## License

**GitLab Classrooms** is licensed under the terms of [Mozilla Public License 2.0](LICENSE).
