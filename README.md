**Gitlab Classroom** is a modest clone of [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), aimed at Gitlab.

**Gitlab Classrooms** helps _Teachers_ to:

* create Gitlab groups for a class
* give assignment for the _Students_
* automate _Students_ repositories creation in the Group
* use project templates, to have a code skeleton to start with
* grade work automatically by importing test results

_Students_ can:

* access their assignments
* create their repositories automatically by simply joining a class with a magic link
* see their grade on each assignment

**Gitlab Classroom** uses Gitlab OAuth2 provider to authenticate _Teachers_ and _Students_.
