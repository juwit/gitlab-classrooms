Each _Assignment_ card displays its type with an icon (Exercise or Quiz).

_Exercise Assignments_ show a link to open the associated GitLab project.

_Quiz Assignments_ show a link to take the associated Quiz.

When a Quiz, or Exercise has been submitted, the submission date and score is also displayed on the card.
