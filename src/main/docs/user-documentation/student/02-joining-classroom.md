# Joining a _Classroom_

A _Teacher_ may give you a _Join Link_.

These links have the following form : `http://gitlab-classrooms.com/classrooms/04baf115-b2ca-4120-99e3-4cb385595a49/join`.

When clicking this link, you **MAY** be redirected to the _GitLab Classroom_ login page first, then you will see the _Join Classroom_ page.
