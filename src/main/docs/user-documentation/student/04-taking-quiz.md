# Taking a Quiz

By cliking on the _Answer Quiz_ link from your [_Student Dashboard_](./01-student-dashboard.md), or after accepting a _Assignment_, you open the Quiz Page.

## Question types

There are 3 types of questions:

* multiple-choice questions, using checkboxes. There can be one or more correct response can (even all responses can be correct).

* single-choice questions, using radio buttons. There can be only one correct response.

## Submitting the Quiz

After you answered all the questions, you can submit the quiz with the _Submit_ button at the bottom of the page.

If you submit a Quiz without answering all the questions, an error is displayed.

  ![Error for partial quiz submission](04-partial-answer-error.png){ style="border: solid 1px black" }

</figure>

If all questions are answered, you are redirected to the quiz result page.

The page shows you your score. The questions you correctly answered are highlighted in green, the incorrect answers are highlight in red. Only the question title is highlighted, the correct answer is not given (because you can retake a quiz if the _Teacher_ let you do so).

## Re-Taking a Quiz

If the _Teacher_ allows it, you can re-take a Quiz you have already taken.

In that case, _Gitlab Classroom_ show you a warning with your previous score and submission date.

Be advised that your new answers will override the previous submission.
