# The _Classroom_ page

The _Classroom_ page is accessed when clicking a _Classroom_ card in the [_Teacher Dashboard_](./teacher-dashboard.md).

The _Classroom_ page lists:

* The _Students_ who joined the _Classroom_.
* The _Assignments_ of the _Classroom_.

It also provides a link to access the GitLab Group of the _Classroom_ on your GitLab instance and a [_Join Link_](../student/joining-classroom.md)
and a button to [create an _Assignment_](./creating-assignment.md).

When the _Classroom_ is just created, it displays an empty view.

When the _Classroom_ has _Students_ and _Assignments_, it will show them as cards.
